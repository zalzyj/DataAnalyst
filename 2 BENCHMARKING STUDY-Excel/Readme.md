# EXCEL ANALYTICS PROJECT 1 – BENCHMARKING STUDY

### Critical thinking is one of many skills employers are looking for from college graduates. In this assignment, students will work on developing this important skill using Microsoft Excel as a tool. 

## Prerequisites Skills

1. Open, save, close, and navigate through a
workbook and worksheet
2. Plan and create a workbook
3. Enter text, dates, and numbers data
4. Enter basic formulas
5. Enter basic SUM, AVERAGE, and COUNT
functions
6. Use AutoFill and Flashfill
7. Format cells content, background, and
borders
8. Prepare and format a worksheet for printing

## Case Scenario
One day at a family dinner, your dad and your
uncle got into a debate about which basketball
team is better. Your dad is a loyal fan of the State
University while your uncle graduated from the
University of State, a big rival of the State
University. Your great aunt chimed in that the
University of Next- State’s basketball team is the
best.
You mentioned that there are multiple different
ways you can compare the performance of the
basketball teams and you will bring in your
analysis to the next family dinner.
Project Requirements

1. Please watch the “What is Benchmarking?”
video to learn about Benchmarking, an
approach used by many organizations to
measure and compare themselves with
others. The video is available at
https://youtu.be/R6tJpyaFiQc.
2. Visit the College Basketball Stats and History
website at http://www.sportsreference.com/cbb/.
Select three
comparable college men’s basketball teams
(to represent the three college teams from
the above scenario) and locate their latest
complete season statistics on the website.
3. Using Microsoft Excel, please conduct a
benchmarking study comparing the
performance of the three men’s basketball
teams side-by-side.
4. For each of the three teams, locate statistics
that represents each TEAM's, not conference,
performance. At the minimum, please
include the following performance indicators
for each team:
    + Number of games won
    + Number of games lost
    + PTS -- Total Points
    + G -- Games (i.e., number of games
played during the season)
    + FG% -- Field Goal Percentage
    + 2P% -- 2-Point Field Goal Percentage
    + TOV -- Total Turnovers
5. Please write an Excel formula to calculate the
following statistics for each team:
    + Win-lose percentage (W-L%) =
Number of games won / Total number
of games played
    + Average points per game = Total
Points / Total number of games
played
    + Average Turnovers per Game = Total
Turnovers / Total number of games
played
6. Provide TWO additional performance
indicators that you think are appropriate.
7. Use clear titles, labels, sheet name, and other
appropriate spreadsheet formats (e.g., font
type, size, colors, borders, etc.) so users can
easily locate the information.
8. Include appropriate information on the Page
Header and Page Footer
9. Apply appropriate settings so that all
information will be printed on one page.
10. Use information from your analysis to
answer the following questions:
    - According to the data, which team had
the highest Win-lose percentage (WL%)?
    - According to the data, which team had
the highest Field Goal Percentage (FG%)?
    - What is the Average Points per Game for
the State University, i.e., your dad’s
favorite team, during the most recent
season?
    - What is the Average Turnovers per Game
for the University of State, i.e., your
uncle’s favorite team, during the most
recent season?
    - According to the data, which team had
the best performance in the most recent
season when it comes to Turnovers?
Note: In basketball, a turnover occurs
when a team loses possession of the ball
to the opposing team before a player
takes a shot at his team's basket.
    - Discussion: What were the two additional
performance indicators that you
selected? Why did you choose these
indicators and which team performed the
best according to these indicators?
Please explain your answer.
    - Discussion: According to your
spreadsheet, which performance
indicator do you think is the most
important for this analysis and
why? Please explain your answer.
    - Discussion: Among the three teams,
which team do you think performed the
best during the season and why? Please
explain your answer using information
from the analyses you conducted on the
spreadsheet.
