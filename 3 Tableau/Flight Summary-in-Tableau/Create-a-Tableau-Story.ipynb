    "The follwing steps were taken in order to create a comprehensive csv file.\n",
    "1. Multiple datasets were downloaded from the website of U.S. Burueat of Transportation Statistics from year 2000 to 2016. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Only scheduled flights related to passengers are kept while those of freight and unschedule flights are removed.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Rows with 0 total passengers are deleted as it doesn't add up to anything in our final dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Each row of data is duplicated except that its origin and destination are swapped. It is done as we also need to consider the number for destination city without changing the structure of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. The data is then pivoted in Excel to calculate annual number of passenger by airlines by city pairs.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Once the data is loaded into Tableau, airport pair and city pair are created by combining the airport code and city name.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Another calculated field is also created to filter out city pairs with less than 500 passengers annually when calculating the connectivity of an airport (number of airport with direct flight) so there were lots of one-off flights which will skewed the data, such as Singapore-Raleigh which is never flown by any commercial airlines."
